* tributary.el

GNU/Emacs major mode to edit Atlassian Confluence wiki pages.

=tributary.el= can pull a wiki page via Confluence REST API, edit it
in as XML file, and update remote page.

IMPORTANT: This software is in *alpha* quality!  I decided to release
it anyways as an MVP.


** How to use

1. Set =tributary-api-url=, e.g.,

   #+begin_src elisp
   (setq tributary-api-url "https://example.com/wiki/rest/api/content/")
   #+end_src

2. Configure authentication.

   - Create an API token for your Confluence account.

   - Make this token available to =auth-source.el= (this is what
     =request.el= / =tributary.el= use for authentication).

3. Pull a page.

   - =M-x tributary-pull-id=
   - Input numerical ID of the page.

4. Edit your page in [[https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-storage-format-790796544.html][Confluence Storage Format]].

5. Push by typing =C-c C-c=.
